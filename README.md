Sentiment analysis is one of applications where Machine Learning shows promising performance. In this project, we will conduct sentiment classification using several ML methods. Decision Tree, SVM, Linear Regression and KNN are used in this repository. For each of these, we have done a grid search to find the best parameters in terms of the performance.
