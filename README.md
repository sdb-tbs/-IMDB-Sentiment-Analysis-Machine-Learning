# IMDB-Sentiment-Analysis-Machine-Learning
Sentiment analysis is one of applications where Machine Learning shows promising performance. In this project, we will conduct sentiment classification using several ML methods. Decision Tree, SVM, Linear Regression and KNN are used in this repository. For each of these, I have done a grid search to find the best parameters in terms of the performance.



IMDB is an online database with information about movie and television series which also allows user to leave comments and critical review. Predicting whether the
reviews are positive or negative using the classification techniques is an on-demand application. You can download the dataset from [here](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/). You should see a train and a test folder.
